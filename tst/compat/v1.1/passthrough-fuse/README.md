This directory contains binaries of `passthrough-fuse` from release `v1.2B2`. Both `x64` and `x86` binaries are provided.

The WinFsp-FUSE layer added support for `struct fuse_stat_ex` in `v1.2B3` which was a potentially breaking change for backwards compatibility. These binaries are used to verify that WinFsp-FUSE remains backwards compatible.
