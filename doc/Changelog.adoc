v0.14::

- WinFsp-FUSE now uses the S-1-0-65534 <-> 65534 mapping for unmapped SID/UID's. The Anonymous SID mapping from the previous release had security issues.


v0.13::

This release includes a Cygwin package, an API change and some other minor changes:

- New Cygwin package includes `cygfuse-2.8.dll` and `libfuse-2.8.dll.a` for easy use in the Cygwin environment. This is currently offered as a separate download.
- Minor but breaking API change: `SetFileSize`/`SetAllocationSize` have been consolidated. Please refer to the documentation for a description of the changes.
- File system drive symbolic links (`DefineDosDeviceW`) now automatically cleaned up even if user mode file system crashes or is terminated forcefully.
- WinFsp-FUSE now maps unmapped UID's to the Anonymous SID (S-1-5-7). See: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2016-06/msg00359.html
